Detecting defects in an automotive part using opencv
Project Overview: This project aims to develop a computer vision-based system capable of autonomously inspecting and identifying defects or imperfections in cast metal parts. 
The system will use conventional artificial vision techniques with the opencv library, 
with this type of system we are not looking for robustness but to verify the effectiveness of a traditional system, 
as we carry out the project, conclusions will be drawn if with only opencv it is possible achieve system stability.
